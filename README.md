# Demo React App to demonstrate understanding of key concepts. 
The app displays a random collection of bars in a histogram. When the user presses play, the bars are sorted using one of three algorithms while animating the action.
Inspiration for this app was provided by codedamn's video: https://youtu.be/3PPydQOjyHA?t=2138.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
